Each of the problems was solved in a separate file.
Their tests (Problem 4) are found in each of the files.

If you are on Mac or Linux, you can execute each solution by first compiling it and you can run it.

Ex. for Problem 1: 

```
-> rustc problem1.rc
-> ./problem1
```

If you are on Windows, once compiled, a .exe will be generated.
```
-> ./problem1.exe
```
